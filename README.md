# Welcome! 👋

**CEBRA** is a library for estimating **C**onsistent **E**m**B**eddings of high-dimensional **R**ecordings using **A**uxiliary variables. It contains self-supervised learning algorithms implemented in PyTorch, and has support for a variety of different datasets common in biology and neuroscience.

To receive updates on code releases, please 👀 watch or ⭐️ star this repository!

``cebra`` is a self-supervised method for non-linear clustering that allows for label-informed time series analysis.
It can jointly use behavioral and neural data in a hypothesis- or discovery-driven manner to produce consistent, high-performance latent spaces. While it is not specific to neural and behavioral data, this is the first domain we used the tool in. This application case is to obtain a consistent representation of latent variables driving activity and behavior, improving decoding accuracy of behavioral variables over standard supervised learning, and obtaining embeddings which are robust to domain shifts.

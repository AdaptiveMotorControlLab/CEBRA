    """Compute the Jacobian matrix for a given model and input.

    This function computes the Jacobian matrix using PyTorch's autograd functionality.
    The Jacobian represents the first-order partial derivatives of the model's output
    with respect to its input parameters. It supports both CPU and CUDA computation,
    as well as single and double precision.

    Args:
        model: PyTorch model to compute Jacobian for. The model should be callable
            with the input variables.
        input_vars: List of input tensors to compute the Jacobian with respect to.
            Each tensor should have requires_grad=True if gradients are needed.
        mode: Computation mode. Currently only "autograd" is supported, which uses
            PyTorch's automatic differentiation.
        cuda_device: CUDA device identifier to use for computation (e.g., "cuda:0").
            Ignored if double_precision is True.
        double_precision: If True, use double precision (float64) for computation.
            This moves all tensors to CPU.
        convert_to_numpy: If True, convert the output Jacobian to a numpy array.
            If False, returns a PyTorch tensor.
        hybrid_solver: If True, concatenate multiple model outputs along dimension 1
            before computing the Jacobian. Useful for models with multiple outputs.

    Returns:
        Jacobian matrix as either a PyTorch tensor or numpy array. The shape is
        (batch_size, output_dim, input_dim), where:
        - batch_size is the size of the input batch
        - output_dim is the dimension of the model's output
        - input_dim is the total dimension of all input variables

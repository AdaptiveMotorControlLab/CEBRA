"""Pre-defined neural network model architectures

This package contains everything related to implementing data encoders and the loss functions
applied to the feature spaces. :py:mod:`cebra.models.criterions` contains the implementations of
InfoNCE and other contrastive losses. All additions regarding how data is encoded and losses are
computed should be added to this package.

        The reason for this implementation is that ``dataset[i]`` will in
        general have different dimensions (for example, number of neurons),
        per session. In contrast to the reference and positive
        indices, this data cannot be stacked and models need to be applied
        session by session.

    After data processing, the dimensionality of the returned features
    matches. The resulting embeddings can be concatenated, and shuffling
    (across the session axis) can be applied to the reference samples, or
    reversed for the positive samples.

    Note:
        This function does currently not support explicitly selected
        discrete indices. They should be added as dimensions to the
        continuous index. More weight can be added to the discrete
        dimensions by using larger values in one-hot coding.

    TODO:
        * Add a dedicated sampler for mixed multi session sampling.
        * Add better CUDA support and refactor ``numpy`` implementation.

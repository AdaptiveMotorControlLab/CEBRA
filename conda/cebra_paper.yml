# This environment is the full requirements to reproduce the first cebra paper (although we recommend using docker).
#This is NOT needed if you only intend to use cebra.
#ubuntu and windows uers can simply install tensorflow=2.2.
#Mac non-M1, also just install tensorflow=2.2
#Mac M1 chip requires a rosetta compatible build.

Multi-objective models
======================

Starting in CEBRA 0.6.0, we have added support for subspace contrastive learning.
This is a method for training models that are able to learn multiple subspaces of the
feature space simultaneously.

Subspace contrastive learning requires to use specialized models and criterions.

Welcome to CEBRA's documentation!
=================================

CEBRA is a library for estimating Consistent EmBeddings of high-dimensional Recordings using Auxiliary variables.
It contains self-supervised learning algorithms implemented in PyTorch, and has support for
a variety of different datasets common in biology and neuroscience.

Please support the development of CEBRA by starring and/or watching the project on Github_!

.. note::

   CEBRA is under active development and the API might include breaking changes
   between versions. If you use CEBRA in your work, we recommend to double check
   your current version. For writing reproducible analysis and experiment code, we recommend
   to use Docker.

Installation and Setup
----------------------

Please see the dedicated :doc:`Installation Guide </installation>` for information on installation options using ``conda``, ``pip`` and ``docker``.

Have fun! üòÅ

Usage
-----

Please head over to the :doc:`Usage </usage>` tab to find step-by-step instructions to use CEBRA on your data. For example use cases, see the :doc:`Demos </demos>` tab.

Integrations
------------

CEBRA can be directly integrated with existing libraries commonly used in data analysis. The ``cebra.integrations`` module
is getting actively extended. Right now, we offer integrations for ``scikit-learn``-like usage of CEBRA, a package making use of ``matplotlib`` to plot the CEBRA model results, as well as the
possibility to compute CEBRA embeddings on DeepLabCut_ outputs directly.


Licensing
---------

Since version 0.4.0, CEBRA is open source software under an Apache 2.0 license.
Prior versions 0.1.0 to 0.3.1 were released for academic use only.

Please see the full license file on Github_ for further information.


Contributing
------------

Please refer to the :doc:`Contributing </contributing>` tab to find our guidelines on contributions.

Code contributors
-----------------

The CEBRA code was originally developed by Steffen Schneider, Jin H. Lee, and Mackenzie Mathis (up to internal version 0.0.2). As of March 2023, it is being actively extended and maintained by `Steffen Schneider`_, `C√©lia Benquet`_, and `Mackenzie Mathis`_.

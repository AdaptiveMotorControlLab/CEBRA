      # NOTE(stes): To avoid issues as observed in
      # https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA/pull/20, we modified
      # this workflow to not rely on PATs. All repos except for the website
      # repo are public and only read access is required, so we simply removed
      # the tokens from the checkout actions.
      #
      # For pushing the docs, I temporarily disabled the staging repo, which
      # does not add anything informative to the contributor anyways, as it just
      # tests whether or not docs can be pushed (the staging branch is not deployed).

      # The production branch will be built after the PR is merged to main.

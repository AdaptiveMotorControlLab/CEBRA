CEBRA was initially developed by **Mackenzie Mathis** and **Steffen Schneider** (2021+), who are co-inventors on the patent application [WO2023143843](https://infoscience.epfl.ch/entities/patent/0d9debed-4d22-47b7-bad1-f211e7010323). 
**Jin Hwa Lee** contributed significantly to our first paper:  

> **Schneider, S., Lee, J.H., & Mathis, M.W.**  
> [*Learnable latent embeddings for joint behavioural and neural analysis.*](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06031-6) 
> Nature 617, 360–368 (2023)

CEBRA is actively developed by [**Mackenzie Mathis**](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/) and [**Steffen Schneider**](https://dynamical-inference.ai/) and their labs.  

It is a publicly available tool that has benefited from contributions and suggestions from many individuals: [CEBRA/graphs/contributors](https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CEBRA/graphs/contributors).

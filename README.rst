Welcome! This repo will host the official implementation for ``cebra``, an algorithm to estimate **C**\ onsistent **E**\ m\ **B**\ eddings of high-dimensional **R**\ ecordings using **A**\ uxiliary variables. To receive updates on the code release, please *:eyes: watch* or *:star: star* this repository!

``cebra`` is a method for non-linear clustering that allows for label-informed time series analysis.
In particular, it leverages constrastive learning to get insights into neuroscience experiments
with paired behavior and neural recordings. The main application case is to obtain a consistent
representation of latent variables driving activity and behavior, improving decoding accuracy
of behavioral variables over standard supervised learning, and obtaining embeddings which are robust
to domain shifts.
